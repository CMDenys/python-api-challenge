<h1>Part I - WeatherPy</h1>

To better understand weather patterns in various cities across the world, a representative model was created using Python libraries and the OpenWeatherMap API to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. 

To create a list of cities, NumPy was used to create a set of random latitude and longitude combinations.  Once the lat/lng coordinates were produced, citipy was used to identify the nearest city to each coordinate.
